[1m[33mWarning: [0m[0m[1mValue for undeclared variable[0m

[0mThe root module does not declare a variable named "ssh_public_key" but a value
was found in file "terraform.tfvars". To use this value, add a "variable"
block to the configuration.

Using a variables file to set an undeclared variable is deprecated and will
become an error in a future release. If you wish to provide certain "global"
settings to all configurations in your organization, use TF_VAR_...
environment variables to set these instead.
